## Summary

As a Systems Administrator/Engineer with over a decade of experience I have
always thrived solving new and complex problems. I have managed and built a
wide variety of cutting edge and mission critical technologies. I am excited
by new situations outside of my expertise and am quick to embrace technologies
new and old. For me, tomorrow's problems are an opportunity to better myself
today.

As a member of Pulsara, I automate application code and infrastructure
deployments using principles of immutable infrastructure. I specialize in
creating automated, repeatable processes to eliminate traditionally manual
systems automation tasks including but not limited to: machine image creation,
firewall management, network operations, security, and data archival.


**_Company Impact:_**

* Replaced single point of failure database node with highly available
  Galera MySQL cluster split across AWS availability zones.

* Split web servers and utilty traffic across AWS availability zones to
  improve high availability.

* Designed and implemented failover procedures and automation for primary
  database node.

* Create and use Chef Solo recipes for server image provisioning.
  Provisioning is used by Vagrant, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud
  Platform for server image creation.

* Implemented monitoring using Datadog monitoring to gather machine
  performance and monitor systems.  This includes creation of custom monitors
  and metrics.

* Implemented OSSEC host based IDS system for security.  Designed OSSEC
  key exchange/registration process using beanstalkd for automated deployment.
  Notifications are presented in Slack versus traditional email system.

* Documented and streamlined creation of infrastructure and stack updates
  using AWS Cloud Formation and Google Deployment Manager.

* Updated production web server deployment to allow for close to zero
  noticeable impact to customers.

* Updated TLS profiles on Elastic load balancers to allow only acceptable
  cipher sets.

* Rebuilt entire Pulsara software and infrastructure stack on Google Cloud
  Platform using GCP Deployment Manager.  This included reworking cloud
  provisioning into a single source template based provision system.

* Wrote HIPAA compliant de-identified database extraction process for
  internal and customer audits.

* Reduce product latency by continually reviewing MySQL slow log for
  problem queries and queries not using indexes.
